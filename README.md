# mandelbrot images

This is a python script I hacked together and need to take a look at again someday.

Its really disorganized and inefficient.
There are also some images I made. It's a mess

Required packages
```
- numba (for @jit compilation, maybe use CUDA cores?)
- matplotlib
- numpy
```
