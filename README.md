# mandelbrot images

This is a python script I hacked together and need to take a look at again someday.

Required imports
```
- numba (for @jit compilation)
- matplotlib
- numpy
```

Its really disorganized and inefficient.
There are also some [images I made](images/README.md). It's a mess  

Seriously, don't use this yet. I don't even know what it does. I'll update this one day (maybe)

#### ~~But it makes pretty pictures~~
